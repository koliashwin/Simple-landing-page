- CSS Grid

**There are only 2 main files in the project:**
- **index.html** : this file contains the html code
- **styles.css** : this file contains CSS for styling

### What I learned

I learnd about responsive web design and how to use @media queries in CSS

### Continued development

I'll be working on some frontend libraries in my next projects. Also I want to practice grid system for better control of web elements.
